## ArrayVisualizer for Visual Studio 2017 ##

This project was forked from [Codeplex](http://arrayvisualizer.codeplex.com/). All credits go to **Amir Liberman** who created the project initially.
I just migrated the whole project to Visual Studio 2017 since it is a really neat extension.

### How do I get set up? ###

Either go to **[Releases](https://github.com/Skyppid/Array-Visualizer/releases)** and just get the latest .vsix-Installer, or build it yourself.
You will have to create your own signature key file and set up all projects with it in order to build.

The following workloads are necessary to build:
* .Net Desktop Development
* Visual Studio Extension Development
